- Optimized revenue by forecasting churn-related financial impact.
- Provided actionable insights to marketing teams for personalized campaigns.
- Offered a scalable approach applicable across various industries (retail, banking, healthcare).

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL Server, Power BI, and Machine Learning can be integrated to analyze churn, predict customer behavior, and drive strategic decisions. The combination of advanced analytics and visualization enhances retention efforts, ensuring long-term business growth.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Set Up Database**:
   - Import the customer dataset into SQL Server.
   - Use the provided SQL scripts to clean and structure data.
2. **Load Data into Power BI**:
   - Connect Power BI to SQL Server.
   - Use the provided views (`vw_ChurnData`, `vw_JoinData`) for visualization.
3. **Train Predictive Model**:
   - Run the Python script to train and evaluate the logistic regression model.
4. **Deploy Dashboard**:
   - Publish the Power BI report for real-time monitoring.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement advanced machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for better prediction accuracy.
- Incorporate real-time data streaming for dynamic churn monitoring.
- Develop automated alerts for at-risk customers to trigger retention actions.
